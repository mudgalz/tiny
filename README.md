# Simple Gallery Page

This is a simple gallery page which allows users to search and download photos from two sources: Pexels and Pixabay. The page also includes filters and search features.

## Features

- Search for photos by keyword
- Filter photos by Type, Orientation and colors.
- Change the source of photos
- Download photos

## How it works

The page uses the Pexels and Pixabay APIs to search for photos based on the user's input. The search results are then displayed in a grid, with each photo showing its title, description, and a "Download" button. When the user clicks on the "Download" button, the photo is downloaded to their computer.

## Why I made this

I made this page to learn more about using APIs and to practice building a simple web app. I also wanted to provide a simple way for users to search and download photos from Pexels and Pixabay.

## Tech used

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- ESLint
- Pexels API
- Pixabay API
- React Query
- Shadcn
